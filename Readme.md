# GlaDOS
GlaDOS is an attempt at making an x86 operating system (inspired by the video game portal) from scratch.

### Goals: 
* A text based interface.
* Keyboard (and maybe joystick) input
* A basic filesystem (Data files, program files, etc.)
* The OS kernel!
* The ability to port to different system architectures.
* Software: 
    * BASIC compiler
    * Text editor / compiler for our own games engine
    * Small (text based) games
* Sound?

### Tools:

* QEmu: https://www.qemu.org/
* Make: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
* GCC: https://gcc.gnu.org/
* We write all the code on Ubuntu 20.04
