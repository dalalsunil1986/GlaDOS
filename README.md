# aperture-os
We want to create an os from scratch.
Inspired by this paper: https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf

### Goals: 
* A text based interface.
* Keyboard input
* Filesystem (Data files, program files, etc.)
* The OS kernel!
* The ability to port to different system architectures.
* Software: 
    * Text editor / compiler for our own games engine
    * Small (text based) games
* Sound?

### So far: 
* We have succesfully created an empty boot sector (bootsector.bin) which we can open in VirtualBox

### Tools: 
* This paper: https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf
